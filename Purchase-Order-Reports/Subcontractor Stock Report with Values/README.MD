# üìä Subcontractor Stock Report with Values

[‚¨ÖÔ∏è Back to Purchase Order Reports](../)

## üìã Overview

This ABAP report provides comprehensive visibility into subcontractor stock levels and values, tracking both raw materials (ROH) at vendor locations and finished goods (FG) produced through subcontracting. Built with AI assistance to eliminate dependency on technical teams, this report empowers SAP MM consultants to monitor and analyze subcontractor inventory efficiently.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Company-Specific Customizations Required

**This report contains hardcoded values that MUST be customized before use!**

### üî¥ Mandatory Changes:

#### 1. **Company Code** üè¢
**Current**: Hardcoded as `'1000'`  
**Location**: Form `merge_stock_data` (line ~875)
```abap
SELECT SINGLE waers FROM t001 INTO @DATA(lv_waers) WHERE bukrs = '1000'.
```
**Required Action**: Change to your company code or make dynamic

#### 2. **Local Currency** üí∞
**Current**: Defaults to `'USD'` if company code not found  
**Location**: Form `merge_stock_data` (line ~877)
```abap
IF sy-subrc <> 0.
  lv_waers = 'USD'.  " Default if company code not found
ENDIF.
```
**Required Action**: Change default currency to your local currency

#### 3. **Fiscal Year Calendar** üìÖ
**Current**: Assumes fiscal year starts in July (SAP standard)  
**Location**: Multiple places - `INITIALIZATION` and `convert_periods_to_dates`
```abap
" Line ~69: Fiscal year logic
IF lv_current_month >= 7.
  p_fryr = sy-datum(4).
```
**Required Action**: Adjust if your fiscal year differs:
- April start: Change 7 to 4
- January start: Change 7 to 1
- October start: Change 7 to 10

#### 4. **Language Settings** üåê
**Current**: Hardcoded as `'E'` (English) for descriptions  
**Location**: Form `get_descriptions` (line ~1687)
```abap
WHERE spras = 'E'.
```
**Required Action**: Change to your required language or use `sy-langu`

#### 5. **Movement Types** üì¶
**Current**: Specific movement types for subcontracting  
**Location**: Form `read_mseg_transactions`
```abap
" Raw materials movements:
AND ( bwart = '101' OR bwart = '102' OR  " GR/Reversal
      bwart = '541' OR bwart = '542' OR  " Transfer/Reversal
      bwart = '543' OR bwart = '544' OR  " Special stock transfer
      bwart = '701' OR bwart = '702' ).  " Consumption/Reversal
```
**Required Action**: Verify these match your subcontracting process

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Customize the Code

#### 1.1 Update Company Settings
```abap
" Add at report beginning:
CONSTANTS: gc_bukrs TYPE bukrs VALUE 'YOUR_COMPANY_CODE',
           gc_waers TYPE waers VALUE 'YOUR_CURRENCY'.

" Update in merge_stock_data:
SELECT SINGLE waers FROM t001 INTO @DATA(lv_waers) WHERE bukrs = gc_bukrs.
IF sy-subrc <> 0.
  lv_waers = gc_waers.
ENDIF.
```

#### 1.2 Fix Fiscal Year (if needed)
```abap
" For April-March fiscal year:
IF lv_current_month >= 4.
  p_fryr = sy-datum(4).
ELSE
  p_fryr = sy-datum(4) - 1.
ENDIF.

" Update convert_periods_to_dates accordingly
```

#### 1.3 Language Settings
```abap
" Replace all:
WHERE spras = 'E'
" With:
WHERE spras = @sy-langu
```

### Step 2: Create and Test

1. **Create Program**: SE38 ‚Üí `ZSUBCONTRACTOR_STOCK_REPORT`
2. **Initial Test**: Run with single vendor for current period
3. **Validate**:
   - [ ] Currency displays correctly
   - [ ] Stock quantities match MSLB
   - [ ] Values calculate properly
   - [ ] Fiscal periods work correctly

### Step 3: Deploy

1. **Create Transaction**: SE93 ‚Üí `ZMM_SUBCON_STOCK`
2. **Authorization**: Ensure users have access to required tables
3. **Training**: Create user guide with your customizations

## ü§ñ AI-Powered Development

This report was developed using AI assistance to:
- Handle complex fiscal period calculations
- Implement dual stock type tracking (ROH & FG)
- Create sophisticated ALV hierarchy
- Optimize performance for large datasets
- Generate comprehensive error handling

**Note**: While AI accelerated development, all code has been tested and validated in real SAP environments to ensure accuracy and performance.

## ‚ö° Performance Considerations

- **Data Volume**: Optimized for 100K+ records
- **Database Access**: Uses FOR ALL ENTRIES efficiently
- **Period Logic**: Minimizes table reads by checking current period once
- **Background Processing**: Supported for large selections
- **Memory Management**: Clears work areas appropriately

### Performance Tips:
1. Limit date ranges for faster execution
2. Use material selection to reduce data
3. Run in background for historical analysis
4. Save ALV layouts to avoid reconfiguration

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"No stock data found"**
- ‚úì Check vendor has special stock indicator 'O'
- ‚úì Verify fiscal year/period selection
- ‚úì Ensure subcontracting POs exist
- ‚úì Check authorizations for MSLB/MSLBH

**"Values showing as zero"**
- ‚úì Verify material has moving average price
- ‚úì Check MBEW/MBEWH entries exist
- ‚úì Ensure price unit (PEINH) is maintained
- ‚úì Confirm valuation area is active

**"Wrong fiscal period"**
- ‚úì Verify your fiscal year variant
- ‚úì Check initialization logic matches your calendar
- ‚úì Ensure period conversion is correct

**"Missing finished goods"**
- ‚úì Check goods receipts have movement type 101
- ‚úì Verify subcontracting indicator in PO
- ‚úì Ensure no special stock indicator on FG

### Debug Points:
```abap
" Key areas to set breakpoints:
FORM calculate_previous_period.     " Period calculation
FORM get_fg_materials.             " FG identification
FORM read_stock_balances.          " Stock retrieval
FORM merge_stock_data.             " Value calculation
```
